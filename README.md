RIG Summer Project - Google Glass

This repository contains the source code for our WKU Google Glass application.
This application was designed for the students of our local university in the
hopes of connecting them to useful campus information such as meal plan counts, dining dollars, campus news, events, directions,  and dining facility information

This application was designed and developed by Lydia Buzzard, Peter Kaminski, and Logan Houchens, under the mentorship of Dr. Uta Ziegler of Western Kentucky University.
